Push and pull [Irmin](https://irmin.org) stores over [RTC Datachannels](https://webrtc.org/getting-started/data-channels) from one browser
to another.

Data is being sent and received if you do some manual signaling, you might need to refresh the page to see the updated text. No fancy merging is happening... yet!
